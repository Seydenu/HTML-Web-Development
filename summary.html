 	<h1>Box Model Summary</h1>

 	<a href="index.html">Back Home</a>

 	<p>Firstly, everything that,s displayed in CSS is a box.</p>

 	<h3>Content & Sizing</h3>

 	<p>Boxes have different brhaviors based on theis display value, their set dimensions and the content that lives within them.</p>
 	<p>You can control this by using "extrinsic sizing" or you can let the browser make decision for you using "instrinsic sizing."</p>
 	<p>Using instrinsic sizing can allow the browser to well place your contents on the webpage as it should best fit.</p>
 	<p>When the element is using the extrinsic sizing, there's a limit of how much content you can add before it overflows out of it element's bounds, but this isn't the case with when instrinsic sizing is toggled on.</p>

 	<h3>The areas of the box model</h3>

 	<p>Boxes are made up of: Margin box, border box, padding box, & content box.</p>
 	<ol>
 		
 		<li>The Content Box - Is the area the content lives in. This content can control the size of its parents, so is most likely the most variable sized area.</li>
 		<li>The Padding - Sorrounds the content box and it's the space created by the padding property.</li>
 		<li>The Border Box - Sorrounds the padding box and its space is occupied by the border value.</li>
 		<li>The Margin box - Is the space around your box, defined by the margin rule on your box.</li>
 	</ol>

 	<h3>Controlling the Box Model</h3>

 	<p>It's the user agent style where the box's default "display" is set, for example: If we're in a normal flow, a "div" element's default "display" value is "block", a "li" has default display value of "list-items", and "span" has a default display value of "inline".</p>
